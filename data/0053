I have served in SGA since my freshman year; two years as an Oxford senator and this year as a SGA and College Council Legislator. Our platform is RISE, standing for Response, Inclusivity, Spirit, and Excellence. With increasing concerns around sexual assault, DEI, and access to wellness resources, Emory needs a leader who can address these issues head-on, and my personal experiences can provide support to those who need it. As an Oxford Continuee, I understand the importance of making “One Emory” REAL, and that all communities on campus feel like they belong. I plan on increasing representation for underrepresented groups, as well as stronger accountability and transparency in SGA. I’m always looking for feedback from the student body, so please reach out to me through email atmakenzie.jones@emory.eduto start discussing change!Khegan MeyersMy name is Khegan Meyers (he/him) and I am running to be your Student Government Association President. In the past three years, I’ve served in College Council and BBA Council as an SGA Legislator, including as the Ranking Member of the Legislature. I am proud to run alongside Andrew Yang, Oxford SGA President. I’m running this year because I’ve experienced challenges at Emory that were results of lack of institutional support. Having worked with students in and outside of SGA to make change, I know that it takes both student leaders and students themselves to make a change to Emory to provide that support. I want to work alongside you to improve student health – physical, mental, & reproductive – and provide an inclusive environment of belonging at Emory through promoting accessibility, equity, and justice. We have real plans for real change. We hope you can join us in it.Rizky Lubis is also running for SGA President butdid not respond to requests for elections materials.SGA Vice PresidentAbigail DubinskiHello! My name is Abigail Dubinski (she/her), and I’m a second-year SGA and College Council legislator running for SGA Vice President. I am a candidate with the necessary experience in advocating for all students regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or religion. My platform focuses on addressing the concerns of Emory’s students with a particular emphasis on response, inclusivity, spirit, and excellence. As Vice President, I intend to increase accountability within SGA and promote inclusivity by hosting more events that celebrate diversity and well-being across all colleges. I understand that Emory is not just a place to get a degree, but a community dedicated to ensuring every student feels safe, welcome, and included. Vote for me as Vice President of SGA and MaKenzie Jones for President for a more responsive and inclusive student government! Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to share your thoughts. My email is abigail.dubinski@emory.edu.Andrew YangHello, my name is Andrew Yang (he/him) and I am running to serve as your Emory SGA Vice President alongside Khegan Meyers. Currently, I am serving as the President of Oxford SGA and I am seeking the opportunity to continue my work with our community. As the Vice President, I want to empower student leaders and their initiatives by leveraging my position to create relationships and forge partnerships with major stakeholders. As for my priorities, the student concerns I have heard are (I like to work with quotes): “Emory is diverse, but not inclusive,” “Emory was not there for me when I needed them,” and “resources are not available evenly for Oxford and Atlanta.” And we have a greater platform that encompasses much more than this. I would love to hear your advice on my priorities and our platform. I look forward to collaborating with you to create a Happier Emory!Jayden DavisHello Emory students! My name is Jayden Davis (he/him), and I am excited to announce my candidacy for the position of Executive Vice President in the upcoming Student Government Association (SGA) election. With extensive experience managing student finances, I recognize the need to modernize the SGS system to make it more accessible and efficient for all students. As Vice President of Club Sports and on their budget committee, I have managed budgets and ensured fair fund allocation. As the Emory Gymnastics Team President, I am committed to providing resources and support to all student organizations. My leadership roles on campus have demonstrated effective communication, collaboration, and prioritization of student needs. If elected, I will work tirelessly to ensure that the SGA is responsive to the needs of all students and continues towards a more equitable and inclusive campus community. Thank you for your consideration, and I hope to earn your vote.Davis has not provided the Wheel with a campaign video at the time of publication.College CouncilCC PresidentNeha MurthyHi everyone! My name is Neha Murthy (she/her). When I started my freshman year at Emory during the pandemic, like any first-year student, I was eager to find my place on campus. However, as COVID-19 exacerbated existing gaps in the support infrastructure for campus life, my goal to find community was dampened and I realized I fell victim to a common story lived by many Emory students: not feeling a sense of belonging at Emory due to the enormous untapped potential in our campus life. I was lost. I didn’t know how to get involved. And I didn’t know who to reach out to or how. That is why I am running to be your next College Council President – by listening to your stories and taking concrete action, I will reimagine our shared Emory experience towards a more vibrant, spirited community where no student feels left behind. Learn more about my platform – Neha CARES – as you scroll through my Instagram post and at my websitenehamurthymusic.wixsite.com/nehacares.Daniel NadelAs a candidate for College Council President, I am committed to improving our campus experience in a number of ways, including adding new meal plan options and expanding airport shuttles for students during break. Currently Emory does not give underclassmen many options for meal plans and even less which are reasonably affordable to students. I would lead an initiative with Emory to increase the total number of meal plans offered and ensure that students would be able to select a plan which allows them to save money. I also am seeking to expand the airport shuttles that run during breaks as this eliminates the high uber costs that many students have to pay. I strongly believe that by expanding meal plan options and increasing the frequency of airport shuttles during breaks, we can make our campus experience more enjoyable, affordable, and convenient for everyone.CC Vice PresidentMuhammad SamiAssalam-o-alaikum! (Peace upon y’all) I’m Sami and I’m running for CC VP. My platform is based on three passions of mine: advocating for minority groups, promoting inter-faith, and digitizing resources. What does any of this mean? First, I am advocating for flexibility in food and dining during breaks, as low-income and international students often stay on-campus and encounter challenges with food options. Additionally, I want to foster a healthier community for students of differing belief systems. I will work with secular and non-secular organizations to make religious spaces more accommodating to non-religious students, and vice versa. My third initiative consists of a centralized resource database, where students can find available research positions all in one place. I also plan to change CC informational channels from written instructions to visualized guidance. I believe that empowering student organizations can move us away from administrative reliance and towards a future of student-led change.BBABBA PresidentMichael ChanHi! My name is Michael Chan (he/him), and I’m running for BBA Council President. Over the past school year, I’ve collaborated in the BBA community as a Junior Representative on BBA Council, President of Goizueta Pride, and BBA Career Coach at the Career Management Center. Through each of these experiences, I’ve interacted with students of every background and have gained an understanding of student needs. I want to strengthen the Goizueta community with my three part campaign platform: 1) Fost Connection, 2) Cultivate Communication, and 3) Build Belonging. Feel free to read more about my platform at linktr.ee/michael4bba and reach out with your thoughts. Thank you!Natalia SzalayHello! My name is Natalia Szalay, and I’m running for BBA Council President. Serving as Treasurer and Special Activities Chair on the Student Programming Council provided a comprehensive knowledge of Campus Life during and in the aftermath of the pandemic; These tools have allowed me to revitalize the Emory Food Chain and help newly admitted students navigate their transition into the college as a first year and into the Business School as an Orientation Leader. As structural changes define a new Goizueta experience, my platform centers around 1) championing and normalizing student feedback in executive decision-making, 2) promoting philanthropy and sustainability initiatives within KEGS 3) fostering inclusive engagement within and outside of the classroom. Feel free to visit my website at nataliaszalay2023.com, reach me on Instagram, or send any inquiries, ideas, and commentary my way via email or during Office Hours (Wednesdays; 9:00 PM – 11:00 PM).BBA Vice PresidentLiam O’SullivanHello Emory! My name is Liam O’Sullivan, and I am running to be your BBA Council EVP. I hope to represent your thoughts, ideas, and needs in the coming year. I will lead with a focus on transparency, inclusivity, and community. To address each focus, I will host coffee chats and town halls as it is my strong belief that leaders should spend less time talking, and more time listening. I will additionally seek to create a new position titled “Onboarding Representative” as well as documents to help matriculated sophomores and BBA minors feel welcome and prepared for GBS. I plan on working closely with the VPs to ensure that clubs at GBS are held to a high standard and are providing students with opportunities to grow. I will strive to reinforce Goizueta’s value for collaboration by helping students feel accepted and ready to chart their own path at Emory.Lily ShortHey y’all! I’m Lily Short and I’m running for Executive Vice President of BBA Council. I’ve had so much fun serving as a Junior Representative on BBA Council this past year. As Junior Rep., I’ve been able to plan fun, educational programming (Dating Do’s and Don’ts!) as well as more overarching initiatives like pre-BBA Coffee Chats. In the coming year, I want to continue to approach bettering Goizueta on both of these fronts – creating a better overall Goizeuta student life experience through programming that is both enjoyable and helpful as well as a more efficient and transparent Council. My platform is mostly based on three aspects of me as a: Transfer, double major in the College, and Junior Rep. I also hope to enrich mentorship and social impact within Goizueta. I hope you’ll read my full platform and enjoy hearing about my goals for the upcoming year. Thank you!!Web page designed by Hayley Powers and Gabriella Lewis.
