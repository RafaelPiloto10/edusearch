With this knowledge, researchers say, communities can better protect themselves from infection.The first-of-its-kind study followed a cohort of 3,521 children in western and coastal Kenya from 2014-2018, testing them for evidence of three potentially deadly, mosquito-borne illnesses: dengue, chikungunya, and malaria. Researchers followed children because it was easier to understand when and where infections occurred in this younger cohort. By mapping the infections and comparing them with demographic data they gathered, researchers found overlapping hot spots for all three diseases across multiple years. The hot spots were associated with the presence of litter near homes, crowded living arrangements, and relatively greater wealth.The trash-disease connectionThe study,published March 29 inBMC Infectious Diseases, adds to a growing body of research that finds strong links between plastic trash and mosquito-borne illness. With formal trash collection still a burgeoning trade in Kenya, many households instead manage their waste by storing it outside their homes and eventually burning it. Plastic containers and rubber tires can hold water that pools during heavy rains, making an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.“These findings underscore our growing concerns over the risks that trash, particularly plastic waste, poses to human health,” said senior authorDesiree LaBeaud, MD, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases and global health faculty fellow at the StanfordCenter for Innovation in Global Health. “Empowering people to clean up trash from their communities is a clear win-win for human and environmental health.”Exploring under-studied diseasesThe study evolved from the researchers’ desire to better understand the prevalence of two mosquito-borne illnesses, dengue and chikungunya. Like malaria, these diseases are spread by mosquito bites and cause high fever and joint pain. While the symptoms are often mild to moderate, dengue and chikungunya infections can become severe, even deadly.HERI-Kenya volunteers collected more than 1,000 pounds of trash during a recent trash cleanup in the town of Ukunda in November 2021.(Image credit: HERI-Kenya)Despite this, there is little awareness or testing capacity to promptly diagnose dengue and chikungunya in Kenya. Researchers suspected that dengue and chikungunya were in fact responsible for many of the infections attributed to malaria, which is often assumed to be the cause of patients’ fevers.“When a patient comes into the clinic with a fever, it’s important to be able to make an accurate diagnosis,” saidAslam Khan, DO, a clinical assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases, global health faculty fellow, and lead author of the study. “Without the ability to make an accurate diagnosis, we risk over-prescribing ineffective antimalarials or antibiotics, building antibiotic resistance.”Common hotspots offer win-win solutionsOverall, 9.8% of children in the study had antibodies in their bloodstream indicating a prior infection for chikungunya and 5.5% were for dengue. Of children who were tested, 39.1% were positive for malaria. The researchers were surprised to find hot spots where the risk for all three diseases was higher.Desiree LaBeaud and Kenyan colleague Dr. Francis Mutuku plant saplings in discarded plastic containers recovered during a trash cleanup with local schoolchildren in March 2018.(Image credit: Desiree LaBeaud)“These common hot spots suggest that both the built environment and social factors can significantly influence the risk of various mosquito-borne infections,” said Khan.The study also indicated that malaria risk had the strongest association with litter.Currently, most of Kenya’s prevention measures are targeted toward theAnophelesspecies of mosquito that causes malaria, which bites at night. For instance, bed netting is a common malaria intervention that does little to prevent dengue or chikungunya, which are spread by a mosquito active during the day. This study, Khan said, revealed measures that could be effective at targeting both mosquitoes, including using window screens, eliminating open water containers, and removing trash from around homes.LaBeaud noted that the link between trash and malaria was particularly interesting given that a new malaria vector,Anopheles stephensi,was recently discoveredfor the first timein northern Kenya. Like theAedes aegyptimosquito that spreads dengue and chikungunya,Anopheles stephensihas adapted to breeding in human-made water containers in urban areas. LaBeaud’s team is exploring future studies to see if this mosquito is involved in malaria transmission where they are working.HERI Kenya, a nonprofit organization co-founded by LaBeaud in response to her findings about the connection between plastic trash and disease, is working to empower and educate Kenyan communities to clean up and recycle plastic trash.Doing so offers many additional health and economic benefits to the community, including reduced pollution, fewer toxic fumes from burning waste, and new income opportunities for recyclers, LaBeaud said.Khan hopes the study will also help support increased awareness and testing capacity for dengue and chikungunya. He said he has already seen a shift in awareness on the part of the health workers who helped with the study. “Our community team members are now very cognizant that dengue and chikungunya could be the culprits when they see a sick patient,” he said.LaBeaud is also a senior fellow of theStanford Woods Institute for the Environmentand a member ofBio-Xand theMaternal & Child Health Research Institute. Khan is also a global health faculty fellow at the Stanford Center for Innovation in Global Health and a member of the Maternal & Child Health Research Institute, which supported his salary for work on this project.This research was funded by the National Institutes of Health.To read all stories about Stanford science, subscribe to the biweeklyStanford Science Digest.Media ContactsAslam Khan, School of Medicine: (415) 562-7326;akhan1@stanford.eduJamie Hansen, Global Health Communications Manager: (707) 536-1436;jmhansen@stanford.eduScience & TechnologyHealthSustainabilityFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailWhat to read next:Science & TechnologyVirtual touchThree years into the Zoom era, roboticist Allison Okamura thinks it’s time for technology that reconnects us with the physical world.MedicinePadded helmet cover shows little protection for football playersResearchers tested a padded helmet cover meant to protect football players from head injury and found that it likely offers little benefit for the majority of hits players sustain.Science & TechnologyResearchers find new molecule that shows promise in slowing SARS-CoV-2A molecule with hooks that can grip and disable the virus’s pesky protease shows potential for fighting infection.Stanford ReportTo receive Stanford news daily,subscribe toStanford Report.For JournalistsPress ReleasesMedia ContactsStanford ExpertsSee AlsoContact Stanford NewsFaculty / Staff ResourcesEventsEvents calendarStanford News is a publication ofStanford University CommunicationsStanford HomeMaps & DirectionsSearch StanfordEmergency InfoTerms of UsePrivacyCopyrightTrademarksNon-DiscriminationAccessibility©Stanford University.Stanford,California94305.
