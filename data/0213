The Future of Everything
Climate change doesn't only impact the weather patterns, but also the prevalence of mosquito populations and the diseases they spread. | Shutterstock/mycteria
Rising temperatures and rainfall from climate change will have a surprising effect on human health, says biologist
Erin Mordecai
, an expert in diseases borne by mosquitoes, ticks and other living creatures.
Such conditions are perfect breeding grounds for parasites that will bring deadly diseases to the U.S. and other places once thought out of reach. Hope may rest in mathematical models to guide smarter environmental policies, as Mordecai tells host
Russ Altman
on this episode of Stanford Engineering’s
