What We Do
Our mission is simple: We promote the research, clinical and educational enterprise of Stanford Medicine.
Even as the media ecosystem has rapidly evolved, our passion for delivering high quality, creative communications services remains as strong as ever.
While our mission is simple, we specialize in the complex: Staff members in the Office of Communications are skilled at communicating technical and innovative ideas to targeted audiences across a
wide range of media
. The Office of Communications is comprised of a team of dedicated writers, editors, communications strategists, social media producers, and media relations experts. The team has a wealth of experience promoting biomedical research and major clinical advancements.
In addition to providing high-quality coverage of the work happening at Stanford Health Care and the School of Medicine, our office provides a broad range of
services
, including media relations, social media strategic consulting, and media training.
And if you work in media and need sources for your stories, whether you're telling them on a broadcast network, newspaper or on a blog,
we can help
get you access to the expertise you need to make those stories as compelling as possible.
We look forward to working with you.
