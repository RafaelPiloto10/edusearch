Testing policy for Fall 2023 and Fall 2024 applicants
For the 2022–23 and 2023–24 admission cycles, Stanford will not require ACT or SAT scores for first-year or transfer applicants. We recognize the ongoing challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, including limited access to admission testing worldwide, and as a result, our test optional policy will extend to applicants applying for Fall 2023 and Fall 2024 entry terms.

Stanford is committed to a holistic review of all candidates. We consider the vast array of information provided in and with each student’s application, whether that information includes test scores or not. Students may continue to self-report test scores in their application if they would like. Applications without test scores will not be at a disadvantage.
The
NCAA Eligibility Center
has announced a standardized testing policy for students who intend to play NCAA Division I or II sports starting in the 2022–23 academic year. “Students who initially enroll full time during the 2021–22 or 2022–23 academic years and intend to play NCAA Division I or II athletics will not be required to take a standardized test to meet NCAA initial-eligibility requirements.” Please check the NCAA eligibility website for updates to NCAA requirements for future academic years.
