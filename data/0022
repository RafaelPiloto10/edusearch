Howard Lamar decided to enroll in the Emory College of Arts and Sciences, which had a profound impact on him, Sarah Lamar said. Her father wasfascinatedwith the West, and the lateCharles Howard Candler Professor of American Social HistoryHarvey Young and the late Dean of Alumni Prentice Miller (27C, 28G) reportedlyencouragedthat interest.Howard Lamar alsoreceivedan honorary degree from Emory in 1975.He later accepted an invitation by former University President James Laney to chair the Emory Visiting Committee for the Arts and Sciences in 1980, one year after former Coca-Cola Company President Robert Woodruff (1912C) and his brother George Woodruff donated $105 million to Emory,University Historian EmeritusGary Hauk (91G) wrote in an email to the Wheel. The committee evaluated and strengthened academics at Emory.The committee suggested that the University hire young assistant and associate professors tohelpEmory achieve higher goals. They also pushed Emory toopena neurosciences division, an immunobiology program and a comprehensive cancer center — all of which exist today, Hauk noted in his book, “Where Courageous Inquiry Leads: The Emerging Life of Emory University.”“Howard Lamar was not only a superb historian but also a deft academic administrator, distinguished Emory alumnus and good friend to many at Emory,”Hauk wrote.Sarah Lamar said that her father’s positive experience at Emory inspired her to attend the Emory School of Law.“The Emory community sends our condolences to his family and friends, as well as the countless others who benefited from his leadership and mentorship,”Assistant Vice President of University Communications and Marketing Laura Diamondwrote in an email to the Wheel.After his undergraduate years at Emory, Howard Lamar earned his Ph.D. at Yale, where hetaughtAmerican Western History for almost 40 years and served as chair of the history department.

Howard Lamar held the position until 1993.During his career at Yale, Howard Lamar is credited withrevolutionizingthe study of the American West. Hechallengedhistorian Frederick Jackson Turner’s influential “frontier thesis” and argued for a more critical examination of the power struggles that occurred during the development of the West.Howard R. Lamar Professor of History and American Studies at Yale Ned Blackhawk wrote in an email to the Wheel that Howard Lamar worked to “deepen the intellectual currents and scholarly infrastructure” of Western history.“He had a particularly profound influence on his students, several of whom became founding figures of the ‘New Western History’ of the early 1990s,” Blackhawk wrote. “He trained more than a generation of U.S. western historians, several of whom would also become prominent Native American historians.”Former Yale University President Howard Lamar (45C) passed away after a lifetime of work on the American West. (Courtesy of Yale University)During his career, Howard Lamar published six books about the American West. Sarah Lamar said that writing one of his books — “The New Encyclopedia of the American West” — was her father’s proudest accomplishment. In 2000, Yalefoundedthe Howard R. Lamar Center for the Study of Frontiers and Borders to advance scholarship on the American West and honor his contributions to the field.Holding the title of Yale president was the “role of a lifetime” that capped off Howard Lamar’s career, Sarah Lamar said.“Where he probably had the most sense of accomplishment was in the diaspora, if you will, of guiding and encouraging and helping graduate students at Yale go out into the nation and be placed at great universities all over America to teach and carry on the work of Western history,” Sarah Lamar said.Sarah Lamar added that her father was very kind, generous and always had time to help students with their work. Her father advised about 60 dissertations during his time as a history professor at Yale.“He was always trying to encourage and, in many ways, be a cheerleader for his kids and a lot of people who worked with him as a professor would say the same thing about his encouragement of them,” Sarah Lamar said. “The other thing that I could take away from my dad, and others would as well, would be just being a good person and being kind to others and doing it with humility and not screaming from the rafters that you’re doing good things. He was very quiet in the way that he helped people and his generosity and his kindness to others.”Spencer Friedland+ postsAsst.
