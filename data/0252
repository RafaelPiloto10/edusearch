Faculty, postdocs, students and staff advance ocean research, education, and impact through interdisciplinary collaboration, technology development, use-inspired research, immersive education and training. To advance exploration and knowledge of our blue planet, and tackle the most pressing challenges in climate and sustainability, the Oceans Department brings together ocean science (including biological, physical, and social sciences), technology, and solutions into an academic unit focused on ocean discovery and solutions.Degree programsUndergraduateUndergraduate students interested in studying the ocean first need to apply to Stanford University. Once at Stanford, students can pursue their interest in ocean research through either the department of Biology or Earth Systems.Stanford undergraduate admissionsBiologyEarth SystemsGraduateWe are still in the process of building a full Oceans curriculum and PhD program, thereforefor the 2022-2023 PhD application season, the process will be run through existing programs.Oceans faculty will be recruiting students throughEarth System Science. For those faculty appointed 50/50 in Biology and Oceans, they can recruit students via theBiology Department (CMOB or Eco/Evo track) orEarth System Science. For those appointed 50/50 in CEE and Oceans, theCEE applicationwill be used. Given the complexity of admissions this cycle, it's imperative that you reach out to the individual faculty member you hope to work with regarding the appropriate application and track to choose.Earth System ScienceBiologyCivil and Environmental EngineeringFacultyBarbara BlockCharles and Elizabeth Prothro Professor of Marine Sciences, Professor of Oceans and Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the EnvironmentAlexandria BoehmProfessor of Civil and Environmental Engineering, of Oceans and Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the EnvironmentKaren CasciottiAssociate Dean for Facilities and Shared Labs, Professor of Earth System Science and Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the EnvironmentLarry CrowderEdward Ricketts Provostial Professor, Professor of Oceans, Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment and Professor, by courtesy, of BiologyGiulio De LeoProfessor of Oceans, of Earth System Science, Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment and Professor, by courtesy of BiologyAnne DekasAssistant Professor of Earth System Science and, by courtesy, of Oceans and of Earth and Planetary SciencesMark DennyJohn B. and Jean De Nault Professor of Marine Science at the Hopkins Marine Station, EmeritusRob DunbarW.M.
