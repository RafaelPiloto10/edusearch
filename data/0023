Her departure follows pressure from an open letter —spearheaded by public health students and professionals —releasedon Feb. 5 calling for her resignation.Sterk cited her resignation as a personal decision, but declined to comment further and did not mention if the open letter contributed to her decision to resign. She is no longerlistedon the Board of Trustees roster.However, Professor of Surgery Douglas Murphy, who represents the Emory Clinic, stillsitson the Board of Trustees. The letter is currentlycallingfor his resignation.Murphy did not respond to multiple requests from the Wheel for comment.In April 2021, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottomsannouncedplans to build an 85 acre, $90-million police training facility called the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, coined “Cop City” by activists. The facility will be located in South River Forest, also called Weelaunee Forest.In total, private donationscomprise80% of Cop City funding. The Board of Trustees is a “public-private” partnership between large Atlanta-based corporations — including the United Parcel Service, The Home Depot, Wells Fargo & Company and Delta Air Lines — and the Atlanta Police Foundation.Additionally, University President Greogry Fenves is a member of the Atlanta Committee for Progress, a group ofmore than 40 Atlanta-based corporate-elite chief executive officers.The Atlanta Committee for Progress has expressed support for Cop City. In 2021, the Committee released a statement detailing Bottoms’requestfor the Committee to “lead a capital campaign to seed the initial private funding for the project,” which theyfulfilled.“President Fenves is a [Atlanta Committee for Progress] board member and is proud to work with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens on the mayor’s priorities for Atlanta,” Assistant Vice President of University Communications and Marketing Laura Diamond wrote in an email to the Wheel.Followingclaimsof affiliation with Cop City, Diamond denied any University-wide connections with the Atlanta Police Foundation.“As an institution, Emory does not have any ties to the Atlanta Police Foundation,” Diamond wrote.Since its conception, plans for Cop City have beenmetwith resistance from members of the Atlanta community. On Jan. 18, 26-year old environmental activist Manuel “Tortuguita”Terán was shot andkilledwhile protesting the construction of Cop City in the Weelaunee Forest. Terán’s death has been called into question by activists, some of whom claim that a lack of bodycam footage andcontradictingwitness accounts warrant the need for further investigation into the events leading up to Terán’s death.The Georgia Bureau of Investigationrespondedto these claims in a Jan. 23 statement, stating that footage of the altercation exists. The footage was released on Feb. 8. However, some activists continue toclaimthat Terán did not fire at the police prior to his death.Terán’s death has sinceburgeonedmovements of protest across the country. Emory studentsgatheredin solidarity at a vigil hosted in honor of Terán on Jan. 23. On Jan. 21, hundreds of protestersgatheredat Underground Atlanta to protest Terán’s death.Protesters march against the construction of Cop City in Atlanta’s Forests (Courtesy of Wikimedia Commons)“We will continue to support the rights of our students, faculty and staff to share their opinions on this issue and others while reminding our community that individuals are speaking for themselves and not on behalf of the University,” Diamond wrote.Diamond added that the University works with law enforcement on a local and state level to ensure and prioritize the safety of the community, and supports the community-wide discussion and engagement  about Cop City.“We encourage our community to engage peacefully and reject and condemn violence in all its forms,” Diamond wrote. “Emory is a place where we discuss and debate the issues that divide us — this is a foundational aspect of our mission to educate.”Somemembers of the Emory community are demanding a University-wide response.Mads Gordon (24C), who signed the open letter, noted that Emory’s large role in the Atlanta community warrants a response on Cop City.“Emory University and Healthcare has a historically significant sway in Atlanta politics,” Gordon wrote in an email to the Wheel. “Given their respective roles as centers for research and providers within the Atlanta community, it is unacceptable that there has been no official statement(s) or public discussion about the Training Facility and the public health impact it will have.”Wittika Chaplet (21Ox, 23C), a member of Emory’s Stop Cop City movement, said that the University has not been transparent in their response to allegations of affiliation with the Atlanta Police Foundation. Chaplet hopes Emory will condemn the actions of the Atlanta Police Foundation and the construction of the police training facility.“Dismissing the responsibility of Emory to take a position on this issue is ridiculous and dismissive and condescending,” Chaplet said.She added that because Emory is currently the topemployerin Atlanta, she believes it is very likely that the construction of Cop City will impact those employed by Emory who live in the surrounding suburban areas. A“There’s an opportunity for Emory to do a lot of good because of this influence,” Chaplet said. “This is an opportunity for it to use its power to stick up for people who are being brutalized, and in the case ofTortuguita, killed, murdered.”Ayla Khan+ postsAyla Khan (she/her) (23 Ox, 25C) is from Nashville, Tennessee, and is majoring in neuroscience and behavioral biology on the pre-med track.
