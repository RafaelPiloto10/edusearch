MIT delta v
MIT delta v
is MIT’s capstone educational accelerator that prepares MIT student entrepreneurs to hit escape velocity and launch into the real world.
We select the best teams from across MIT’s schools with an interesting idea or proof of concept focused on creating impactful, innovation-driven startups, and have them spend three months working full-time concluding with a
Demo Day
in September.
The program is run out of two locations: the Trust Center on the MIT campus and the
NYC Startup Studio
in Manhattan.

The Trust Center Operating System
We create a continuous path for our students from low friction, easy-to-handle
courses
and programs, proceeding to offerings that become more rigorous, demanding, and rewarding.
We work to ensure all offerings are integrated and that the ramp is also customizable for those with different interests, but still with a common base and set of processes. These
guiding principles
allow for growth and innovation while promoting valuable lateral learning for the thousands of MIT students who engage with entrepreneurship each year.
Support MIT Entrepreneurship
We need your help to create the next generation of innovation-driven entrepreneurs, specifically through our life-changing summer accelerator,
MIT delta v
. Please consider supporting the Trust Center; it would be greatly appreciated and allow us to continue to do the important things that can uniquely be done at MIT.
