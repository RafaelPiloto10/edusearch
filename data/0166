Since bees “tend to forage within a mile radius of their hives in urban areas, there’s valuable information about a city or even a neighborhood in the honey they produce, on their bodies and in the debris that lies at the bottom of hives,” writes Linda Poon forBloomberg.Learn more→CNNProf. Carlo Ratti speaks with CNN reporter Sarah Engel about smart cities and the future of AI infrastructure. Ratti says the key to avoiding pitfalls is to keep citizens engaged: “They should be the ones to decide what kind of city they want to live in tomorrow.”Learn more→The GuardianA study co-authored by postdoctoral associate Qian Li has found that “melting ice around Antarctica will cause a rapid slowdown of a major global deep ocean current by 2050 that could alter the world’s climate for centuries and accelerate sea level rise,” reports Graham Readfearn forThe Guardian.Learn more→The Boston GlobeThousands of scientists and tech leaders have signed an open letter published by the Future of Life Institute, co-founded by Prof. Max Tegmark, “calling for a six-month ‘pause’ in further development of AI systems such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and its more advanced version, GPT-4,” reports Hiawatha Bray forThe Boston Globe. “We’re trying to pause development…to ensure we can get the upside from AI without unnecessary downside,” says Tegmark.Learn more→Scientific AmericanIngrid Wickelgren atScientific Americanhighlights a new study from researchers at the McGovern and Broad Institutes, in which they used a bacterial ‘nanosyringe’ to inject large proteins into human cells. “The syringe technology also holds promise for treating cancer because it can be engineered to attach to receptors on certain cancer cells,” writes Wickelgren.Learn more→The Boston GlobeIn an opinion piece forThe Boston Globe, Prof. Christopher R. Knittel explains why electricity bills in Massachusetts can be so high and how to address the issue. “Statelaw requires Massachusetts to cut greenhouse gas emissions relative to 1990 levels by 50 percent by 2030 and by 85 percent by 2050,” writes Knittel. “In short, we need to replace gasoline and natural gas with electricity. But how we price electricity is making this effort to address climate change harder."Learn more→TechCrunchVenti Technologies, a startup co-founded by MIT professors and alumni that builds autonomous vehicles for industrial and logistics centers, has raised $29 million in Series A funding. The company’s “target customer comes from the wide range of supply chain businesses that operate across warehouses, ports and other shipping and logistics environments where vehicles — currently driven by humans — are central to operations,” writes Ingrid Lunden forTechCrunch.Learn more→Financial TimesProf. John Hart, co-founder of VulcanForms, speaks with Rana Foroohar at theFinancial Timesabout the digital manufacturing company, which uses 3D printing with metals to create parts. “Everything we see around us, with the exception of ourselves and the food we grow, is manufactured,” says Hart. “Now, post-pandemic, several forces are aligning to reshape how we make things. We understand the need for agile supply chains. We realize how important production is for our economic and national security. And third, we need to decarbonize, which will require the growth of new manufacturing systems at scale.”Learn more→The Boston GlobeAdjunctProfessorEmeritus Melvin “Mel” King, a political activist, former MA state representative and the first Black person to reach a Boston mayoral general election, has died at 94. “[In 1971], he founded the Community Fellows Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he became an adjunct professor of urban studies and planning.
