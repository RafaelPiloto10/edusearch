Better World
The generosity of MIT’s global community powers the education, research, and innovation at the heart of the Institute. Time and time again, our alumni and friends demonstrate their confidence in the talented people of MIT and their quest to invent, discover, and make a better world.
Scholarships and fellowships funded by our community open a world of opportunities to tomorrow’s changemakers. Professorships nurture research powerhouses and tap the potential of rising stars. Support for the evolution of the physical campus sets the stage for the next 100 years. Unrestricted funds contribute to the acceleration of MIT’s commitment to action on climate change and enable MIT to realize opportunities such as the redevelopment of Kendall Square into a new gateway to MIT. Every contribution and each point of involvement—through volunteering, attending events, and more—enhances the Institute’s infinite potential.
