Thadhani, MD, MPH, Emory’s executive vice president for health affairs, during the ceremony. “This building will facilitate breakthroughs and discoveries across the health sciences that will transform patient care and serve as a training ground for the next generation of clinicians and researchers.”The $313 million cost for the project was funded in large part through a $200 million gift from theRobert W. Woodruff Foundation, as part of a total $400 million gift to Emory University in 2018 — the largest gift in the history of the 187-year-old university.Construction of the facility — which was designed by global architecture firmHOKand constructed byJE Dunnto incorporate features of the Francis Crick Institute in London — began in March 2020 and included 6.8 million pounds of structural steel, 1.1 million pounds of Portuguese marble and 31,315 cubic yards of concrete.The building’s design features a natural-light filled central atrium with a living five-story green wall, a café, large digital experiential collaboration screens, innovation spaces, and formal and informal meeting spaces meant to promote collaboration. Core facilities include advanced imaging (7-T MRI), flow cytometry, high-level containment facilities, an automated biorepository and genomics.With sustainability in mind, HSRB-II was designed to use roughly half (50%) less energy than typical research facilities, which is equivalent to powering more than 100 homes. These sustainable design strategies include a daylighting approach for all occupied spaces; automated shades for mitigating heat gain; a solar panel array; a microgrid energy management system; a green roof plaza along the side of the building facing Emory’s Lullwater Preserve; a geothermal well field below the surface parking; permeable paving at the surface parking; and a rainwater capture system.“This is an extraordinary facility and is a commitment to our belief in people and to the mission of Emory’s Woodruff Health Sciences. It represents the linkage and integration of core mission, scientific discovery and innovation to the enhancement of patient care,” says David Stephens, MD, vice president for research for the Woodruff Health Sciences Center. “You want to come walk through this building and be in this building, you don’t want to just ride the elevator. It will attract and retain exceptional scientists and learners … but more importantly, lessen the disease burden and keep people healthy.”Skip carouselEmory University’s latest beacon of biomedical research, the Health Sciences Research Building II (HSRB II) is a premier facility that boasts unique, collaborative spaces fostering connectivity to translate scientific discoveries into practical solutions.Emory University’s latest beacon of biomedical research, the Health Sciences Research Building II (HSRB II) is a premier facility that boasts unique, collaborative spaces fostering connectivity to translate scientific discoveries into practical solutions.Emory University’s latest beacon of biomedical research, the Health Sciences Research Building II (HSRB II) is a premier facility that boasts unique, collaborative spaces fostering connectivity to translate scientific discoveries into practical solutions.Emory University’s latest beacon of biomedical research, the Health Sciences Research Building II (HSRB II) is a premier facility that boasts unique, collaborative spaces fostering connectivity to translate scientific discoveries into practical solutions.PreviousNextSkip sidebar contentPrintRelated StoriesEmory researchers to develop tools for visualizing brain effects of Alzheimer’s disease and autism spectrum disorderNov. 18, 2022Emory University breaks ground on innovative biomedical research facilityDec. 11, 2019TagsWoodruff Health Sciences CenterSchool of MedicineNews ReleasesArtificial IntelligenceHealth Sciences ResearchWinship Cancer InstituteHealthResearchScienceRecent NewsDownload Emory News PhotoBy downloading Emory news media, you agree to the following terms of use:Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public LicenseBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License ("Public License").
