Research
At MIT, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and possibility is our joyful obsession, and we celebrate fundamental discoveries and practical applications alike. As educators, we also value research as a potent form of
learning by doing
. Through MIT’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (
UROP
), more than 85% of undergraduates enrich their education through engaging in frontline, faculty-led research.
Research flourishes in our 30 departments across
five schools
and
one college
, as well as in dozens of
centers, labs, and programs
that convene experts across disciplines to explore new intellectual frontiers and attack important societal problems. Our on-campus research capabilities are enhanced through the work of MIT
Lincoln Laboratory
, the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
, active research
relationships with industry
, and a wide range of
global collaborations
. In this work, the
MIT Libraries
serve as a crucial partner and a source of important research in their own right.
