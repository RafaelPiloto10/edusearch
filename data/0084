Giving
Your generosity propels Emory's ability to create positive transformation for communities local and beyond.
Giving to Emory is an act of trust not only in what we are doing now but in the innovation, discovery, and service to come from our educators, staff, and students. Whether to support a scholarship, research, or faculty, your gift creates a lasting impression. Donor gifts also enhance the eminence of our scholars by helping us to attract and retain leaders in their fields.
The Future Starts With You
2O36 inspires investment in people for the benefit of people, bringing the Emory community together to build on our mission to serve humanity through knowledge. With an eye on Emory’s bicentennial, 2O36 will spearhead a movement to radically rethink and reshape the future.

Give Through Your IRA
Donors age 70½ or older may give up to $100,000 directly from an individual retirement account (IRA) to qualified charities without paying federal income tax on the distribution.

You can request your QCD be sent directly from your administrator to Emory:

Ask your administrator to include your name and purpose in documentation that will arrive with the gift, such as a cover letter or memo line, to ensure your gift will be applied appropriately and that we can send your receipt.
Donor-Advised Fund
A donor-advised fund (DAF) is a charitable giving program that allows you to combine the most favorable tax benefits with the flexibility to support your favorite causes. DAF Direct enables you to recommend grants to Emory University directly from your DAF (as long as your DAF’s sponsoring organization is participating). Using the DAF Direct widget below, you can initiate a DAF grant recommendation from our website.
