As educators, we also value research as a potent form oflearning by doing. Through MIT’s Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), more than 85% of undergraduates enrich their education through engaging in frontline, faculty-led research.Research flourishes in our 30 departments acrossfive schoolsandone college, as well as in dozens ofcenters, labs, and programsthat convene experts across disciplines to explore new intellectual frontiers and attack important societal problems. Our on-campus research capabilities are enhanced through the work of MITLincoln Laboratory, theWoods Hole Oceanographic Institution, active researchrelationships with industry, and a wide range ofglobal collaborations. In this work, theMIT Librariesserve as a crucial partner and a source of important research in their own right.Your browser does not support the video tag.Centers, Labs & ProgramsMIT continually develops organizations and partnerships that foster interdisciplinary work. Listed here are just some of the MIT labs, centers, and programs where groundbreaking research is happening every day.View Centers, Labs & ProgramsMIT researchers have devised a miniaturized system that can deliver tiny quantities of medicine to brain regions as small as 1 cubic millimeter.Collaborating InstitutionsMIT researchers collaborate with many leading local, national, and international organizations to further drive exploration.View Collaborating InstitutionsResearchers from MIT and the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory are developing a new space boot with built-in sensors and tiny “haptic” motors, whose vibrations can guide the wearer around or over obstacles.Conducting research in a biological engineering labA system from CSAIL uses EEG brain signals to detect if a person notices robots making an error.This student, an Olympic medalist, is developing a device that more precisely measures the curvatures of the blades used for speedskates.Recent faculty research topics in mechanical engineering include pattern formation, fluid dynamics, and soft condensed matter.Ion accelerators play a strong role in magnetic fusion energy research.MIT students have research interests that extend beyond the lab.MIT researchers have developed a new way to image proteins and RNA inside neurons of intact brain tissue.A graduate student works on robotic systems that are tasked with removing items from bins and placing them into boxes.prevnextMassachusetts Institute of TechnologyEducationResearchInnovationAdmissions + AidCampus LifeNewsnews.mit.eduAbout MITAlumniJoin us in building a better world.Massachusetts Institute of Technology77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, USAVisitMapEventsPeopleCareersContactPrivacyAccessibilitySocial Media Hub
