Dear colleagues,
We are writing to share information about a recent data security incident experienced by a vendor that affects portions of our community. The vendor, Brightline, offers virtual behavioral and mental health services for the children of benefits-eligible employees and postdoctoral scholars across Stanford’s group health plans, including Stanford Health Care, Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley, Stanford Medicine Children’s Health, Stanford Medicine Partners, and Stanford University.
Brightline determined the data breach affected only Stanford group health plan participants with dependents under the age of 18. Brightline will begin notifying the affected individuals on or around April 7, 2023. Brightline’s investigation determined that the incident involved data that were mostly demographic in nature, such as subscriber and dependent names, contact information, member ID, dates of birth, and coverage start/end dates.
No Social Security numbers or financial accounts were included, nor did the files contain anything related to medical services, conditions, diagnoses, or claims for the plan participant or their dependent.
The group health plans’ files were shared with Brightline for verification of eligibility under the plans, as well as potential outreach to plan participants eligible to benefit from Brightline’s services.
If you are affected by this data security incident, you should receive a letter (or letters, if you have dependents) from Brightline by mid-April. Each letter will have a unique code for the member and/or dependent to register for free identity theft and credit monitoring. Brightline will also have a call center available to answer your questions. More information, including frequently asked questions, is available on
Brightline’s website
. Employees and their eligible dependents can continue to use Brightline’s virtual services during this time.
We sincerely regret any inconvenience this incident may cause the affected individuals. The confidentiality, privacy, and security of personal information continue to be important priorities for Stanford, and also for the vendors we engage to provide services for our community.
