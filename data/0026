Agree to Disagree
Every year, the Editorial Board creates a special project together – this year, the project theme is “Agree to Disagree.” Members of the Board have all written dissents to previous editorials, rethinking the arguments and reformulating their opinions through a different perspective. During a time of unrelenting opinions, “Agree to Disagree” reminds all of us to step into each others’ shoes and be able to reframe perspectives.
“Oxfordism” has been ill-defined by critics. Sincerely, an Oxford student.

A week ago, I asked ChatGPT for a list of Latinx Georgia state legislators. It responded that, as of 2021, no Latinxs officials were elected in the state. This claim is incorrect. When I re-confronted the AI phenomena, it later listed State Representative Pedro “Pete”...
