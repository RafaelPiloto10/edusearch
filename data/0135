Admissions + Aid
Intensely curious and driven to explore, the people of MIT value rigorous analytical thinking, ingenuity, hands-on problem solving, and
big new ideas
. Stimulating, supportive, and playful, the
MIT community
becomes, for many students, a second home.
In our undergraduate, graduate, and professional admissions, we seek applicants whose strengths, interests, and values are a good match for MIT. Because the Institute is built on the idea that talent and good ideas can come from anywhere, we are a
remarkably diverse community
, drawing students from all 50 states and from 118 countries. Many are members of the first generation in their family to have the opportunity for higher education. Above all, our students learn not to be afraid of hard problems, making their MIT education a springboard for many
careers
— and practical preparation for life.
