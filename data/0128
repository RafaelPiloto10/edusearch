The lifeblood of the Institute’s teaching and research enterprise, ourgraduate studentsandpostdocsrepresent one of the most talented and diverse cohorts in the world. From science and engineering to the arts, architecture, humanities, social sciences, and management, andinterdisciplinary programs, we offer excellence across the board. We also pioneer digital education — likeMITx— which offers flexible access to MIT-rigorous content for learners of all ages.Your browser does not support the video tag.Schools, Departments & the CollegeAcross MIT, faculty help set the global standard of excellence in their disciplines: They are pioneering scholars who love to teach. Deeply engaged in practice, they topple conventional walls between fields in the push for deeper understanding and fresh ideas. In fact, many faculty actively work in at least one of MIT’s interdisciplinary labs, centers, initiatives, and institutes that target crucial challenges, fromclean energytocancer.The MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, opened in fall 2019, is a cross-cutting entity with education and research links across all five schools.Explore DepartmentsTop ResourcesDepartments by SchoolSchool of Architecture and PlanningSchool of EngineeringSchool of Humanities, Arts, and Social SciencesMIT Sloan School of ManagementSchool of ScienceMIT Schwarzman College of ComputingTeaching & LearningOur campus is a workshop for inventing the future and we are all apprentices, learning from each other as we go. Because we like to make things, and we like to make an impact, iconic courses like2.009emphasize designing, inventing, collaborating, and translating students’ expertise to reach the world. Through signature experiential learning programs likeUROP,UPOP,MISTI,PKG,IAP,D-Lab, andSandbox, students can pursue virtually infinite co-curricular and extracurricular projects — here at MIT, throughout the Greater Boston innovation hub, and around the world. Honeycombed with legendary laboratories and dozens ofmakerspaces, a wind tunnel, a research nuclear reactor, and aglass lab, our campus of idiosyncratically numbered buildings adds up to a prime spot to make the most of your potential.Top ResourcesRegistrar’s OfficeCourse Catalog (MIT Bulletin)DoingWellOffice of the First YearOffice of Graduate EducationOffice of Experiential LearningTeaching + Learning LabOpen LearningMIT is pioneering new ways of teaching and learning, on our campus and around the world, by inventing and leveraging digital technologies.MITx, the Institute’s portfolio of massively open online courses, offers flexible access to a range of interactive courses developed and taught by instructors from MIT.
