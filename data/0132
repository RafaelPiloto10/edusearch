MIT’s alumni — entrepreneurs, researchers, policymakers, and above all, leaders — have helped to shape the world we know today. From 3-D printing to bionic prostheses, many of the products and services that define the modern world have sprung from the minds and hands of MIT’s brilliant
alumni community
.
MIT’s nearly 145,000 alumni represent one of the most talented, innovative, and networked communities on the planet. Many remain deeply involved in the life of the Institute. They
volunteer
, serve on boards, head up
regional alumni clubs
, and
generously support
MIT’s students, faculty, and staff. As individuals, their contributions are extraordinary. As a community, their impact is infinite.
