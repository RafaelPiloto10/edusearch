ECLAIR - Intelligent Candidate to Job MatchingECLAIRAboutSolutionsContactIncrease Your Hiring IntelligenceWe reduce resume screening time by 15-fold while equaling (or bettering) the accuracy of a candidate-to-position match performed by a human recruiter.We provide an intuitive job suitability score which can be balanced with other factors, (e.g., diversity, hiring regulations), thus allowing recruiters to retain control of the recruitment processOur solution helps human resource organizations recover and reallocate recruiter time spent on manual resume review without sacrificing                        accuracy.Find Out MoreThe ProblemFifty-two percent of talent acquisition leaders report that the hardest part of recruitment is identifying the ‘right candidates’ from a large and diverse applicant poolMatching applicants to open job positions isa time-consuming screening effort, which relies on imprecise semantic searching, and/or unsophisticated AI screening methodology.Hiring the wrong applicant results in frustration, attrition, and delayed progress which costs the organization time and moneyWe offer ECLAIR - a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to automate the accurate and non-biased identification of suitable job candidates for open job description(s).The SolutionIntelligent Natural Language Resume ProcessingReduced Recruiter InvolvementReduces resume screening time by 15-foldAccurate MatchesEquals (or betters) the accuracy of a human candidate-to-position matchIntuitive Candidate ScoreEasy to understand candidate rating (0-100) for multiple target positionsAPI AccessEasy programmatic integration into existing Applicant Tracking SystemsCurrent StatusContacts for ECLAIR are Elaine Fisher (elaine.fisher [at] emory.edu) and Steve Pittard (wsp [at] emory.edu)ECLAIR is an Emory University-based collaboration between                        members of the Nell Hodgson School of Nursing, the Emory Department of Computer Science, the Department of                         Biostatistics and Bioinformatics in The Emory Rollins School of Public Heath, Emory Healthcare, and                        the Emory Office of Technology Transfer.ECLAIR is an acronym - "Electronic Competence-Level Analysis on Resumes".The early work in support of the project is described in the publication: "Competence-level prediction and resume-job description matching using context-aware transformer model."See https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.679.pdfThe ECLAIR project receives funding from the Georgia Research Alliance via a Phase 1 Development Grant.We are working on a Minimum Viable Prototype in support of our effort.
