The event took place at the site of the future GSE building on Lasuen Mall, between the Main Quad and Meyer Green. It included remarks from Provost Persis Drell and third-year PhD candidate Madison Bunderson, a ceremonial turning of the soil, and a reception.The project includes a renovation of the historic Education Building at 485 Lasuen Mall, construction of a new building at 505 Lasuen Mall, plus the current Barnum Center for Family and Community Partnerships, which will remain and retain the Barnum family name. The three buildings will be connected by a 13,500-square-foot courtyard with a garden and outdoor classroom.Related StoryCampus NewsConstruction set to begin on GSE’s new homeGenerous gifts from Stanford supporters will enable the creation of a unified Graduate School of Education, which will become home to the Stanford Accelerator for Learning and provide contemporary spaces to support research, teaching, and convening.The renovated GSE campus will feature 150,000 square feet of teaching, convening, conference, and community spaces. It will enable new forms of teaching and learning with capacities for changing technologies and project-based work. It will also house theStanford Teacher Education Programand theStanford Accelerator for Learning, which is designed to bring scholars from across the university together with field experts and partners to co-create solutions in learning.“It will foster collaborations to take education into a currently unimaginable and brighter future,” Schwartz said. “In the end, the campus will do what architecture does best: orchestrate social interaction.”The project’s origins date back to the tenure of former GSE DeanClaude Steele, who advocated for a new building. His successor, DeanDeborah Stipek, continued that advocacy and convened a task force to investigate the possibility of new facilities. After Schwartz became dean, he collaborated on a new vision for the school and helped researchers respond to urgent issues of the moment, including the COVID-19 pandemic, widening inequities, and a nationwide reckoning on racism. The project slowed but eventually regained its momentum. Construction and renovation is expected to take about two and a half years to complete.A courtyard connecting the new Stanford Graduate School of Education will include an outdoor classroom and the Mary Bell Floyd Memorial Garden, designed to be in bloom all year.(Image credit: Courtesy William Rawn Associates + CAW Architects)The new campus is made possible by significant philanthropic support from many donors, including lead gifts from longtime Stanford supporters Angela Nomellini, ’75, and husband Ken Olivier, ’74, and Tricia and Jeff Raikes, ’80.“We’re really grateful for your commitment and your contributions to create a new and expanded center for this important work,” said Drell, noting that the GSE plays a central and fundamental role in the university’s mission to pursue knowledge for the benefit of society.Drell also acknowledged the importance of the GSE’s central location on campus and how it will encourage connections and foster collaboration.“The Graduate School of Education’s new expanded home will be a very highly visible beacon of the promise and the potential of education,” she said. “It will draw students, faculty, researchers and practitioners from diverse fields who share the desire to improve outcomes for every kind of learner at any stage of their educational journey.”Bunderson, who studies in the Developmental and Psychological Sciences Program at the GSE, said that her interdisciplinary work – and that of others at the GSE and across Stanford – will greatly benefit from the new campus.“No learning or research can happen without collaborative relationships,” she said. “For those of us who sit at the intersection of multiple fields, it’s this interconnected community of the GSE that’s the scaffold that makes our work possible.”Campus NewsStanford NewsUniversity AffairsFacebookTwitterLinkedInEmailWhat to read next:Graduate School Of BusinessHow savvy shoppers undermined India’s great cash swapConsumers used retail transactions to keep an estimated $1.5 billion out of the country’s tax system.Stanford Law SchoolLaw School clinic helps fight hungerOver three years, a Stanford Law clinic created a mission-critical suite of contracts for Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger relief organization.Campus EventsCampus events planned for National Sexual Assault Awareness Month in AprilStanford’s SHARE Title IX Office is planning a series of events for the month of April in recognition of National Sexual Assault Awareness Month, (SAAM).StanfordReportNews and information for the university community.Get in touchSign up to receive the Stanford Report daily emailFaculty, staff, and students automatically receive Stanford Report emails.
