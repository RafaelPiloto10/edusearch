Sustainability in space means holding satellite launchers accountable : Short Wave
In 1957, the Space Age began with the
launch of Sputnik
, the first artificial satellite. Since then, the number of objects humans have hurled toward the stars has soared to the thousands. As those objects have collided with one another, they've created more space debris in Earth's orbit. According to
some estimates
, all of that debris and human-made space trash, the number of objects — from satellites to screws — could be in the millions. In this iteration of our
AAAS
live show series,
Short Wave
co-host
Aaron Scott
talks to
Danielle Wood
, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, about the dangers of accumulating space debris, and how she and others are working to make space more sustainable.

In 1957, the Space Age began with the
launch of Sputnik
, the first artificial satellite. Since then, the number of objects humans have hurled toward the stars has soared to the thousands. As those objects have collided with one another, they've created more space debris in Earth's orbit. According to
some estimates
, all of that debris and human-made space trash, the number of objects — from satellites to screws — could be in the millions.
This debris has to be tracked to avoid collisions, which can force the International Space Station (ISS) to be
redirected
, disrupting pre-planned initiatives like
space walks
. A collision with space debris
as small as 1 cm
could penetrate ISS shields, harming the station. And the more objects we launch into orbit, the denser the traffic becomes to navigate.
One potential solution? Apply ideas of green sustainability to the companies and governments that do the launching, says
Danielle Wood
, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT.
As part of
Short Wave
's
AAAS
live show series, Danielle sat down with co-host
Aaron Scott
to talk about a vision of sustainability in space. The effort begins with the
Space Sustainability Rating (SSR)
, an incentive system modeled after LEED certifications for green buildings. The system is multifaceted, considering aspects like collision preparedness, information sharing and future debris reductions. At least one company has already applied for and received a certification using the SSR. That
initial rating was bronze
, the lowest of
four possible ratings
.
"In some ways, I was pleased that our first rating was low because it means we are all saying there's more to work to do and to grow," says Wood. For her, the initial rating is simply the entry point for an ongoing conversation with outside companies in the booming space industry. A company's rating is changeable based on their ongoing missions and efforts. The goals is for companies to increasingly own the social responsibility of being major players influencing the future of space exploration and technology.
"We've been dreaming for years of things like space robots being able to build space stations that humans can go visit. Such things are being now going from the dreaming stage to the venture capital stage. ... As we make these dreams a reality, let's be so thoughtful about the possible long term implications of our actions," says Wood.
