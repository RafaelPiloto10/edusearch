Whether over morning coffee or late at night, we regale each other with absurd Instagram videos as often as we talk about how our days went.One January morning, though, a banner for the Carlos Museum’s newexhibit— “And I Must Scream! The Monstrous Expression of Our Global Crises”— pushed us to think bigger. The world is changing quickly, and not always for the better; technology ispermeatingour homes, COVID-19 is stilldominatingcommunity life, populism isreshapingpolitics and climate changethreatensto destroy the world as we know it. Postmodernity is painful, and many of us aren’t dealing with it well. If you ask an Emory student how they’re doing, odds are that they’ll tell you they’re stressed, burned out or worried. What, we wondered, would a good life even look like amid the crisis and change of our time?To find out, we asked the Emory Wheel’s Editorial Board. In this project, you’ll find a wide range of perspectives on well-being and how we can achieve it, from Associate Editor Rachel Broun’s (23C) call for more walkable cities to Editorial Board member Dani Parra del Riego’s (25C) defense of mindfulness. You may disagree with all of us, or you may find a few ideas worth using in your own life. But at its heart, this project is simply here to help you start interrogating what it means to live well as a human being, as a member of your community, or just as yourself. If we accomplish that, we will have succeeded. So, what do you think? What is flourishing in the 21st century?Demetrios Mammas (23C) is the Editorial Board Editor and Ben Thomas (23C) is the Chair of the Editorial Board. Both oversaw“Flourishing in the 21st Century.”[/vc_column_text][vc_separator][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=”1/3″][cq_vc_flipbox frontfullimage=”57387″ backfullimage=”56891″ cardstyle=”bluejeans” link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Femorywheel.com%2Fliving-la-vida-local%2F||target:%20_blank|”][vc_btn title=”Living la vida local” style=”classic” color=”default” align=”center” link=”url:https%3A%2F%2Femorywheel.com%2Fliving-la-vida-local%2F||target:%20_blank|” button_block=”true”][vc_column_text]Without investing in walkable cities, we are failing to invest in ourselves and our cities.
