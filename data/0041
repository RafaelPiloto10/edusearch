The Emory Wheel is Emory University’s only independent, student-run newspaper. The Wheel has been serving the Emory community since 1919. Today, the Wheel publishes content online daily and produces a biweekly Wednesday print edition that highlights the week’s most important stories.
The Wheel is composed of two departments: editorial, which creates all non-advertising content for the Wheel and includes the digital team, and business, which manages the paper’s finances.
To join the Wheel fill out this quick form:
tinyurl.com/Wheel2023
and an editor will reach out to you soon.
