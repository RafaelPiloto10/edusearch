Ron DeSantis has spent his last four yearsdevelopinga national profile as a right wing hardliner whose traditional brand of conservatism contrasts with former President Trump’s identity-based populism. He has become a darling of the right, with national mediadeeminghim a “superstar” and predicting he canassemblea “Reagan coalition” in 2024.One of the central pillars of DeSantis’ platform is an effort to dismantle a system of “indoctrination” in U.S. schools. Several pieces of legislation have glided through both Republican-held chambers in Florida and onto the Governor’s desk in recent months, including the “Stop Woke Act” and the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. DeSantis’ most recent initiative rejected an AP African American Studies class which heclaimedwould advocate for“abolishing prison.”The theory behind these measures is that the U.S. is currently placing too much trust in teachers to avoidideologically driven conclusions and political agendas in the classroom, resulting in biased curricula. However, taking legal action to prevent bias simply shifts that trust onto politicians who benefit directly from the advancement of political agendas. Teachers’ motive to push an ideology is almost always indirect, while lawmakers depend on political agendas to maintain their status and salaries. In other words, education usually comes from teachers, and indoctrination usually comes from government. This sort of effort signals a new, corrosive form of government overreach establishing itself at the heart of DeSantis’ Republican party.As Ronald Reagan, one of the right’s most iconic “superstars” famouslyputit, “The nine most terrifying words in the English language are ‘I’m from the government and I’m here to help.’”DeSantis’ “Stop Woke Act” takes an exclusionary approach to shaping curricula,forbidding teachers from discussing a set of social concepts that are considered damaging and prejudiced in the classroom. Most of these forbidden concepts are already shunned in education, includingteachingthat some races are “morally superior to others.” However, these stipulations become more vagueas one reads further into the bill.For example, the bill forbids teachers from suggesting that certain “virtues” such as“excellence” and “racial colorblindness” are “racist.” “Colorblindness” has long beenscrutinizedas a social justice ideal, considering that disregarding the role race plays insocietyignoresa long history of systemic racism. Equating this questionable virtue with“excellence” and entangling any criticism of it with accusations of racism will likely lead toavoidance of conversations about race in general. Because of its vagueness (among other constitutionalissues), the bill was recentlystruck downby a Florida judge.Just a month prior to the passage of the “Stop Woke Act,” the infamous “Don’t Say Gay” bill was signed into law,promptingnational criticism and condemnation. The function of this bill can be summed up in its preamble, which states its purpose as theprohibition of “classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity.” There is somedisagreement about how exactly this would manifest, but advocates of the billclaimit is aimed at protecting students from sexual information that may be confusing or disturbing at a young age.However, the bill’s explicit focus on LGBTQ teachers suggests some inherently inappropriate or taboo element to these sorts of relationships, and threatens to scandalize conversation that would be perfectly normal in a heterosexual context. For example, an elementary school teacher simply referring to their same-sex spouse may be seen as a violation of the law, despite a long accepted practice of discussing basic family dynamics with students.In order to assess the implications of this legislation, it is important to consider the meaning andmorality of a political agenda in the classroom, and imagine what sources are most likely toproduce this bias.First, a reminder that the difference between education and indoctrination is that indoctrination trains people to accept a certain set of beliefs uncritically. To be uncritical (and disregard information that may lead to an undesired conclusion) is usually a symptom of some ulterior motive that supersedes the desire to understand an unbiased truth. This serves as a working definition for a political agenda. An agenda is uncompromising; it is concerned only with a goal, like ideological conformity for the sake of political obedience or consensus. By this definition, a political agenda is an educational contaminant. DeSantis’ stated ideal of a curriculum of “facts” rather than ideology mustrejectany editorialization on the part of teachers with an agenda in order to ensure that students remain critical, rather than indoctrinated.An ideological statement is characterized by a synthesis of several facts, leading to a broader moralconclusion, often considering alternatives and historical implications. It may be hard for students to determine when a teacher has veered into ideological territory. This means that political opinion may go unidentified and be conflated with fact, or, if identified, may throw underlying facts discussed into question because of the impression of a general political bias.  These statements are also a warning sign that an agenda may be at play. However, just because these assertions can be defined does not mean they can be prohibited,because reverse engineering legislation to forbid ideological conclusions may end up stuntingteachers’ ability to relay underlying facts.For example, let’s say a teacher is giving a lesson on how capitalism incentivizescompanies to use cheap labor from countries with fewer labor protections. This seems like afactual assessment of cause and effect. Let’s say the teacher then makes a blanket statement thatbecause of this, “capitalism is harmful.” This seems inappropriate because the statement is promoting an ideology or agenda. However, if legislation stated that teachers must not make claims like “capitalism isharmful,” then that underlying fact about incentives toward cheap labor (which,on its own, does serve as evidence that capitalism is harmful) is legally questionable and may bedisregarded altogether.Bias in schools is one of the many issues too delicate to be handled by the government. Its broad application and crushing enforcement is too blunt to untangle each individual knot of ideology within a teacher’s worldview. DeSantis must know this. To legislate classroom discourse according to ancient conceptions of pure relationships or vaguely worded virtues that crush and confuse reasonable conversation about the history of race in this country is a step towards indoctrination, not away from it.Justin Leach (25C) is from Wayne, Pennsylvania.Justin Leach+ postsJustin Leach (25C) is from Wayne, Pennsylvania.This author does not have any more posts.Share:PreviousAnna Delvey’s dishonesty shouldn’t be glamorizedNextEmory hosts first Georgia filipino student association summitAbout The AuthorJustin LeachJustin Leach (25C) is from Wayne, Pennsylvania.Related PostsRussia Prompts Detente With CubaJanuary 23, 2015The Generation Separation Phenomenon: Why Does It Exist?October 23, 2015Letter from Editor: Reporting Title IX casesOctober 24, 2022CARTOON: Witnessed at the Last Elections Board Meeting …April 4, 2018Designed byElegant Themes| Powered byWordPressAdvertiseClassifiedsArchivesJob BoardHave The Wheel delivered to your inbox!Get The Wheel delivered to your inbox!Your information will *never* be shared or sold to a 3rd party.
