Welcome!
I am an Associate Professor of Political Science and a Faculty Affiliate of the
Institute for
		      Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS)
at
Massachusetts Institute of
		      Technology
.
I
		      hold a Ph.D. in Politics from Princeton
		      University, where I received a
Harold
		      W. Dodds Fellowship
for 2012-2013. My
		      research interests include International
		      Political Economy, Formal and Quantitative
		      Methodology. My dissertation examines firm-level
		      political incentives to lobby for trade
		      liberalization (Winner of the 2015
Mancur
		      Olson Award
for the Best Dissertation in
		      political economy in the previous two years). An
		      article version of this research received the
		      2018
Michael Wallerstein Award
for the
		      best published article in political economy in
		      the previous year.
I am also interested in “Big Data”
			analysis of international trade. I am
			developing methods for dimension reduction and
			visualization to investigate how the structure
			of international trade and trade politics
			around the globe has evolved over time. I
			maintain two databases for computational
			social science research:
LobbyView
and
TradeLab
. My work has appeared and
		      forthcoming in various academic journals,
		      including

		      Science
