Impact

At Emory College of Arts and Sciences we are dedicated to the discovery of knowledge, the creation of new works, and paradigm-shifting research with broad impact.
Our students learn how to think critically, weigh conflicting evidence, and ask questions that challenge existing orthodoxy. We expect them to communicate with clarity and collaborate within diverse communities.
Our students take these skills into every field as the thought leaders and innovators our complex and interconnected society needs.
Through our dedication to the creation and dissemination of knowledge, we are setting the standard for what a liberal arts research university can achieve.
