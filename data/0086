Everyone recognizes their responsibility to maintain and even promote diversity in the Emory community. By serving as an Academic Fellow for first-year undergraduate students, I aim to help them adapt to and thrive in the new environment and provide tips and guidance along the way. I also joined Emory International Council and became an intern at International Student and Scholar Services to advocate students' needs and assist with planning events and workshops catered to the international community. I cherish the opportunity to be a student here and always love to offer what I have."Tianyi Xu22CBiology Major, Quantitative Sciences MinorCountry of Origin: ChinaIn the event of an international emergency, please contact Emory Police+1.404.727.6111, monitored 24 hours a dayQuestion about the website?Read Emory's global strategiesRegister travel with International SOSEmory Schools and CollegesEmory College of Arts and SciencesOxford CollegeCandler School of TheologyGoizueta Business SchoolJames T.
