The School of Nursing’s associate dean for clinical and community partnerships assembled a team of Emory Healthcare nurses to advise Hill-Rom on developing a model to test the factors and events that disrupt sleep. Temperature, light, noise, and pain have an impact on sleep, and Hill-Rom can address these issues in designing a better hospital bed to increase sleep quality and duration for inpatients.Children's Healthcare of AtlantaChildren’s Healthcare of Atlanta sought to solve design challenges associated with its clinics where patients range from age zero to twenty-two and require different sizes of equipment, exam rooms, information for checking in and checking out, and more. Assistant Professor Ashley Darcy-Mahoney at Emory’s School of Nursing cotaught a course at Georgia Tech to students across many disciplines, from architecture to nursing. Student projects were carried out in full-scale working model clinic rooms, and led to avatars and mobile phone apps to assist with patient flow and improve wait times, flexible room designs with moving walls, simplified (less threatening) clinic designs.For more information about how Emory School of Nursing partners with corporations and health systems, please contact:Susan BakerDirector of Corporate and External Relationssusanbaker@emory.edu404.712.0147‍Clinical and Educational PartnershipsPreparing the Next Generation of NursesSchool of Nursing students maintains partnerships with more than 500 clinical sites in Atlanta and across the United States, providing students with a wide range of clinical experiences  and specializations across the continuum of care.The School of Nursing students maintains partnerships with more than 500 clinical sites in Atlanta and across the United States, providing student with hands-on training in a range of different specialties and clinical environments across the continuum of care – from governmental agencies and public health to community hospitals to corporate and specialty clinics.
