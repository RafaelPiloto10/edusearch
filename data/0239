The Basics
Where is Stanford?
Silicon Valley
Located 35 miles south of San Francisco and 20 miles north of San Jose, Stanford University is in the heart of Northern California’s dynamic "Silicon Valley,” home to Yahoo!, Google, Hewlett-Packard, and many other cutting-edge companies that were started by and continue to be led by Stanford alumni and faculty.
The Bay Area
To the west of the
University’s 8,180-acre campus
are the Santa Cruz Mountains and Pacific Ocean, and to the east San Francisco Bay.  Known as
The Peninsula
, the area is rich in natural beauty, culture, and entertainment.
Palo Alto
Although the University is virtually a community unto itself and even has its own zip code—94305—it calls the
City of Palo Alto
home. Downtown Palo Alto is a short walk from campus and includes many attractions, as well as many shops and restaurants.
