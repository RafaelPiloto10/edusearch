# EduSearch

A browser for education sites built by... students with â™¥.

## Inspiration

This is a project for a data mining course in which we webscrapped various `.edu` websites and their corresponding newsletter sites.
The browser *in theory* should rank the original source higher than their newsletter sites as they're more likely to link to the main
university page.
